# Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning

Machine learning is fundamentally applied mathematics. Understanding the mathematical foundations is crucial for building effective and interpretable ML models.

## 📊 Linear Algebra: The Language of Data

### Vectors and Matrices

In ML, we represent data as vectors and matrices. A vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents a single data point with $n$ features.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating vectors and matrices
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Vector in R³
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2×2 matrix

# Matrix-vector multiplication
y = A @ x  # y = Ax
```

### Matrix Operations

The dot product of two vectors $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$ is:

$$\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i = \|\vec{a}\| \|\vec{b}\| \cos(\theta)$$

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For a square matrix $A$, an eigenvector $\vec{v}$ and eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfy:

$$A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}$$

This is fundamental to PCA (Principal Component Analysis), where eigenvalues represent the variance captured by each principal component.

## 📈 Calculus: Optimization and Learning

### Gradient Descent

The core optimization algorithm in ML. For a loss function $L(\theta)$, gradient descent updates parameters as:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla L(\theta_t)$$

Where $\alpha$ is the learning rate and $\nabla L$ is the gradient.

```python
def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m, n = X.shape
    theta = np.zeros(n)
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Compute predictions
        predictions = X @ theta
        error = predictions - y
        
        # Compute gradient
        gradient = (X.T @ error) / m
        
        # Update parameters
        theta -= learning_rate * gradient
    
    return theta
```

### Chain Rule and Backpropagation

For composite functions, the chain rule enables efficient gradient computation:

$$\frac{dL}{dw} = \frac{dL}{da} \cdot \frac{da}{dw}$$

## 📊 Probability and Statistics

### Bayesian Inference

Bayes' theorem forms the foundation of probabilistic ML:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$

In classification, this becomes:

$$P(y|x) = \frac{P(x|y) \cdot P(y)}{P(x)}$$

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Find parameters $\theta$ that maximize the likelihood of observed data:

$$\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta} \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|\theta)$$

In practice, we maximize the log-likelihood:

$$\log \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log P(x_i|\theta)$$

## 🧮 Information Theory

### Entropy

The entropy of a random variable $X$ with distribution $P$ is:

$$H(X) = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} P(x) \log_2 P(x)$$

Entropy measures uncertainty. Maximum entropy occurs when all outcomes are equally likely.

### Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence

Cross-entropy between true distribution $P$ and predicted $Q$:

$$H(P, Q) = -\sum_{x} P(x) \log_2 Q(x)$$

KL divergence measures how one distribution differs from another:

$$D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{x} P(x) \log_2 \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### Neural Network Mathematics

A simple neural network computes:

$$y = \sigma(W_2 \sigma(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2)$$

Where $\sigma$ is the activation function.

### Regularization

L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function:

$$L_{reg}(\theta) = L(\theta) + \lambda \|\theta\|_2^2$$
